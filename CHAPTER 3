## CHAPTER 3 - WORKING WITH STRINGS

## Basic String Operations: all standard sequence operations work with strings, however item and slice
##                          assignments are illegal as strings are immutable 

## String Methods: many string methods are inherited from the string module where they exist as functions

## Find: a method used to find a substring within a larger string abd returns the leftmost index where the
##       substring is found; if it is not found, -1 is returned
title = "Monty Python's Flying Circus"
title.find('Monty')     #value returned is 0
title.find('Python')    #value returned is 6
title.find('Flying')    #value returned is 15
title.find('Zirquss')   #value returned is -1

## Join: a string method that is the inverse of split; used to join the elements of a sequence
seq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
sep = '+'
seq = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
sep.join(seq) 

## Lower: method returns a lowercase version of the string
'Trondheim Hammer Dance'.lower()       #value prints out 'trondheim hammer dance'
## method is useful for writing code that is case insensitive (code that ignores the difference between 
## upper and lower case letters) 

## Replace: returns a string where all the occurrences of one string have been replaced by another
'This is a test'.replace('is', 'eez')
'Theez eez a test'

## Split: the inverse of join and it is used to split a string into a sequence
'1+2+3+4+5'.split('+')
['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']

## Strip: method returns a string where whitespace on the left and right has been removed
'          internal whitespace is kept          '.strip()
## value returned is 'internal whitespace is kept'
## useful when comparing input to stored values such as when the user accidentally tupes a space after his name
names = ['gumby', 'smith', 'jones']
name = 'gumby '
if name in names: print 'Fount it!'             #returns no value 
if name.strip() in names: print 'Found it!'     #returns Found it!
## it is possible to specify which characters 

## Translate: method replaces parts of a string but that it only works with single characters and requires a 
##            translation table (a table with a full listing of which characters should be replaced by which)
